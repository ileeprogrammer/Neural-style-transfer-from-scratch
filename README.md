# Neural-style-transfer-from-scratch

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my understanding and proficiency in using the VGG16 network for Neural Style Transfer in PyTorch. 

It serves as a showcase of the skills I have acquired in deep neural network architecture and should be considered as a reference only.

I have utilized the default VGG16 weights and model to explore the capabilities of this technique and create new and unique concepts. Please note that this project was a small side project that I completed during the initial stage of my machine learning journey in late 2019 and early 2020.
